	<div class="post-content"><p>I actually don&rsquo;t remember. It was a year ago. I just got into college. Traveling was so tiring for me and, I believe, for everyone living in Dhaka. That enormous traffic and pollution was enough to put myself down. I was new to college, so I didn&rsquo;t know the best route to reach there. I used to travel by bus. Which wasn&rsquo;t the best way of traveling. But at least the way it was, which I knew at that time. Then days passed, and I found another path, which has its own pros and cons.</p>
<p>So about cold drinks, I used to become so thirsty as I had to walk a lot. I would crave something cold. I mostly wanted a nice lemonade. I could have a simple one from a roadside vendor, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be so tasteful. Also, it&rsquo;s a matter of hygiene. But it&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t had lemonade from them. I had quite a lot. I used to go to college with one of my friends. We had to walk a lot; we sometimes stopped to get a lemonade. It actually attracts us to go there. Humidity and tiredness would make us want something cold. Also, it looks so nice to see lemons, ice cubes, and people drinking.</p>
<p>It was actually tasty. I saw how they make it. It&rsquo;s so simple and fast. What they do is just add a little lemon, obviously water, and ice cubes. Nobody knows about its origin. Those ice cubes can even be from the morgue; who cares? All I want is temporary satisfaction. So ice cubes and an unknown recipe looked like salt. Some kind of mixture it was. Then mix it and serve. Quite easy!</p>
<p>Drinking that would satisfy me, but it would make me a bit more exhausted. I don&rsquo;t know why. I know it shouldn&rsquo;t be the case, but it happens to me.</p>
<p>Damn, that was a long road and quite a hassle. Getting on a bus and having a seat was an amazing challenge at that time. I have made a lot of bad choices in my life. One of them was choosing a college that was 9 km far from my home. It might not be a huge distance for people around the world. But here it is a great distance. Time is a valuable thing. Taking decisions like this costs both energy and time. So it means it was just nothing but ruining a beautiful day.</p>
<p>However, I have passed those days. I don&rsquo;t have to go to college anymore. I have a bigger challenge. Maybe when I&rsquo;m in university I&rsquo;ll have to go through this kind of hassle once again. That&rsquo;s how it works here, right? Or maybe everywhere. Suffering is everywhere; suffering is for everyone. One suffers through poverty and another through abundance.</p>
<p>So how was life back then? I thought I had enough time for everything. I didn&rsquo;t know or never tried to understand that time flies so fast. I had a lot of dreams to fulfill. A different ambition, different mindset, different companionship, and different future assumptions. Now I am standing at this date, and I see everything so differently. It didn&rsquo;t go according to my assumptions or plans. It&rsquo;s not the worst, though, but a lot of things have changed, and I am trying my best to get adjusted to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge post I&rsquo;ve written that goes with my life. Not a very great life-changing speech it is. But why must we always seek motivation?</p>
<p>Alright, let me mention some of the realizations that I&rsquo;ve made and end this shit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Accept unexpected consequences and changes in life because it&rsquo;s an uncertain simulation of the creator of this world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s replacement is on the way, and when the replacement arrives, one may replace it with no remorse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today&rsquo;s flower may become tomorrow&rsquo;s thorn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a nap and drinking enough water can sometimes be a solution to a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major decisions should be taken in daylight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take less stress and be optimistic, because life is what you make it. It is painful if you see one better than you, and it is joyous if the better one is you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, people will try to suck your blood, but you gotta point them toward somewhere else of you so they can suck that instead. (ifykyk)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have anything to post, so I did post my thoughts here. It might not help you, but it helps me. We have nothing in our control. We neither can control us nor them. What we have in control is our judgment. How do we accept and how do we not.</p>
