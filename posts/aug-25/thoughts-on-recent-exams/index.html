	<div class="post-content"><p>I recently made a post about my sufferings due to biology exam. Surprisingly, it went nice. Perhaps I wasn&rsquo;t the person who deserved such a smooth exam. I was quite unsure of that exam as I didn&rsquo;t have the will to study. All praise to the almighty!</p>
<p>Besides everything, I was confident with my math exam. Because, I thought I liked to solve problems. I can stick with a problem until I solve it, I have that patience. But sadly this type of thing doesn&rsquo;t get that much value here in this exam or in any exams. Exam is not only about solving problems by thinking critically. Here one has a limited time and within that time one must answer those. Otherwise you be dead.</p>
<p>I realized that I could solve problems but just only when I am in my room lying in my bed. If you live in Bangladesh and keep knowledge about the students. Then you might have already heard that, this year questions are a bit weird. By saying weird I mean that something we didn&rsquo;t expect to see. Everyone thought that, like every year, boards would follow the trend. But it didn&rsquo;t happened so nicely this year. They chose randomness and they did it right.</p>
<p>I will not blame the board for making such questions. If I do, then I clearly trying to blame others for my lacking. I am not trying to be so different than others by stating such fact. I don&rsquo;t even care wether they make questions difficult or easy as I don&rsquo;t really count this exam so fancy phenomena in my life. Society might consider it as a valuable exam but does this exam even justify anything of a student?  Well, I am scared of the society as they will criticize and marginalize me if I fail to do well.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t justify the full potential of a human or a student. At least HSC doesn&rsquo;t! I have attended all the exams of HSC 25 so I know better than any boomers. Here exams are not equal to everyone. One may get some benefit and another may not. So, it might give you a preliminary idea about a person. Though, sometimes, that idea even goes wrong. I&rsquo;ve seen countless people those who didn&rsquo;t do well in HSC but still they are living a good life. They are brilliant and they are no lesser than any other talented students. Now let us get back to the topic.</p>
<p>Yes, questions were so freaking difficult. Not everyone could answer it properly. Those who were hardworking students, they could only answer those. Then would get A+. However, in this way, we can exclude people, those who do not deserve an A+. Thus, we can normalize the fact that getting 4.69 isn&rsquo;t a bad result. Consider only 60 students got A+ in Dhaka board. Then will our parents and the society gonna compare all of us with those 60 people? If they do then it will be pathetic. I believe they will not do. But if 70% students get A+ and the rest can not, then definitely there will be people to say why you weren&rsquo;t in that 70%. Yeah, I said 60, which is a bit unrealistic for this decade but once people saw this sort of era. This year the rate of A+ won&rsquo;t fall so badly, which is clearly visible. But, certainly a downfall will occur. Somehow our standard is messed up (not brining how it got). Hope it gets fixed soon!</p>
<p>From my POV and with my ignorance, I&rsquo;ll say that questions were easy for those who studied. I didn&rsquo;t study so I must not find it easy. If I had studied I would have found it easier. This is the fact here. I don&rsquo;t want to blame others for my failure. Today, it was the worst HSC exam I have ever attended! But, still I have the balls to subdue the sadness that occurs or the tendency of blaming others for my own failure.</p>
