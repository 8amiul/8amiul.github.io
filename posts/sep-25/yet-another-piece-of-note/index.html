	<div class="post-content"><p>Last few months taught me a lot of things. Like always, I observed a lot of acts of people. I wanted to see how people really act and react in several situations. I tried my best to be polite and be a nice guy. I would not directly mention who they are or how I met them, rather I would talk about some different things&hellip; Would like to tell me, about what to do and what not to do. These are my thoughts and it is up to you either to accept or to reject.</p>
<h1 id="when-to-give-advicemotivation-to-someone">When to give advice/motivation to someone?</h1>
<p>What I realized that, we shouldn&rsquo;t be providing advices without being asked. I know it doesn&rsquo;t sound good but do you even know that the other person is ready to accept your advice?  Consuming overwhelming advices can make someone freaked out. I have gone through one recently. Despite my wil to hear, I still continued to grasp all of those, just because I don&rsquo;t want them to call me rude. I could politely handle it, but I try not to argue with those who thinks they know everything. It hurts my ear but still I bear it.</p>
<p>People should not be continuously giving advices to someone who you don&rsquo;t have proper connection with. Even when we are close, we should think before saying something. Saying a thing once is good, twice.. okay fine. But the same thing again and again! Difficult to tolerate.</p>
<h1 id="think-about-everything-react-to-few-things">Think about everything, react to few things</h1>
<p>Like the title mentions, we necessarily don&rsquo;t need to react to every thing around us. Perhaps, think of it first. Then maybe choose to react. I saw people who thinks that they must need to stand with one side at least. But what if we don&rsquo;t consider it necessary to bother with? I could bring more controversial debate but let us not hurt anyone&rsquo;s butt here. So pineapple on pizza or not? I will consider that I don&rsquo;t eat pizza (for the sake of this example). So now, do I really need to react to this question? It is baseless for me as I don&rsquo;t eat pizza. So just reject the question in way a you prefer. Though I like to eat pizza but still it is not really needed to even think of it. Also, I can add a bit extra, in life the more decision one makes, the more consequences he faces.</p>
<h1 id="dont-show-your-covert-superioritynarcissism">Don&rsquo;t show your covert superiority/narcissism</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what amusement one gets buy making themselves the perpetrator. Whoever I talk to, they claim they are the evil and I am the good guy. Another case, I asked someone how he/she was and they replied that they are so evil and evil people live happy. Holy moly! This kinda things make me say like &lsquo;Who the fuck starts a conversation like that! I just sat down.&rsquo; It is a quite common disorder in our generation, I will say. They always act like they are the worst human being alive and they show that they are improving but hardly they improve, more likely to express their superiority in disguise. So I think, when we feel that we could be better, then we should be expressing it a different way where we sound like we actually mean it and don&rsquo;t exaggerate.</p>
<p>So this was it. I guess I mentioned just a few. I can&rsquo;t recall everything now. Maybe in future I will mention more of those things. In life we should learn and apply first then maybe think of resolving others and only then actualizing the thoughts of resolving others (Optional). Also, thinking and actualizing is different, in case one missed.</p>
