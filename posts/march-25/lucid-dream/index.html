<p>Dream is a fascinating phenomena. There are few types of dream. Some has an aspiration, that&rsquo;s one kind of dream, some see they are being haunted by a huge human like entity who got no facial structure just like a mannequin, some see many other interesting things&hellip; which is not our matter of discussion. However, Lucid dreaming is something which allows us to control what we see in our dreams.</p>
<p>Yeah, It&rsquo;s kind of like the scene from Mr. Robot.</p>
<p><em>Mind Awake, body asleep</em></p>

    <img src="/images/posts/lucid-dream/mr-robot.webp" alt="[mr-robot]" title="Mr. Robot">

<p>So, you&rsquo;ll have the full access to do everything, have the allowance to choose and face consequences. But achieving a lucid dream isn&rsquo;t a piece of cake. I was able to lucid dream after continuously trying for a week. You may fail at first attempt, but one can do anything if he has the will.</p>
<p>Now I should share some tips which are followed by lucid dreamers in order to get this insane thing,</p>
<p>Have you ever thought why do we see dreams so vividly when it&rsquo;s early in the morning? around 4-5 o&rsquo;clock. That&rsquo;s the best time for you to lucid dream.</p>
<p>Now get ready to sacrifice your sleep and mental health.</p>
<h2 id="wbtb---wake-back-to-bed">WBTB - Wake Back To Bed</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set an alarm for 30 minutes or an hour after you fall asleep. Try to wake up multiple times like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you&rsquo;ll wake up try staying for at least 5 minutes. On those 5 minutes try to write down what you&rsquo;ve seen, what you&rsquo;ll see or just think that you have to lucid dream.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That was the first technique called WBTB-Wake Back To Bed. This one alone worked for me. This method will at least make you dream more vividly if it doesn&rsquo;t gift you lucid dream.</p>
<h2 id="wild---wake-induced-lucid-dream">WILD - Wake-Induced Lucid Dream</h2>
<p>Next one, have you ever tried to make yourself think what you gonna dream tonight? You close your eyes and start thinking about a random scenario, a scenario where you living a life detached from the society full of creeps. Where you live in peace, do farming, build your house and many more shit. I don&rsquo;t know whether am I the only person to think like that or not but you have to do it for to get A FREAKING LUCID DREAM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell yourself that you&rsquo;ll lucid dream and keep visualizing things that you want to see.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, this method alone won&rsquo;t work, for me it didn&rsquo;t. You have to combine other methods with that to make it work. This one was <em>WILD-Wake-Induced Lucid Dream</em></p>
<h2 id="fild---finger-induced-lucid-dream">FILD - FInger-Induced Lucid Dream</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like pseudo movement of your limbs or fingers. You just trick your brain so that it thinks that you are moving or doing something while you&rsquo;re still lying on bed. You may move your finger a bit but that should be so lightly that it doesn&rsquo;t even look like it&rsquo;s been moved. Consider playing an instrument or the best is typing with keyboard.</p>
<p>Try combining this with <em>WILD</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-did-to-achieve-lucid-dream">What I did to achieve Lucid Dream?</h2>
<p>For me it was quite simple. I combined all these methods and fell asleep on the usual time.</p>
<ul>
<li>I set an alarm for 3 hours.</li>
<li>I woke up and stayed for few minutes, I walked a bit, went washroom, and the again lying on the bed started thinking that I&rsquo;ll lucid dream.</li>
<li>The next thing I did was make myself think I am moving, doing things with my limbs.</li>
<li>One thing, try to lie in bed with a different or unusual position. Maybe change or reverse the sleeping position.</li>
<li>While my eyes were closed I tried to move my eyeballs like we do while we actually see things with opened eyes.</li>
<li>Then I focused on hearing things around me.</li>
<li>Try best to rest your body and make yourself comfortable.</li>
<li>Hopefully you&rsquo;ll achieve what you wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did to get this weird thing working. It was an amazing feeling. The dream was a bit different, when I did it first I saw that I was in my house and could go anywhere and do anything. But I couldn&rsquo;t visit a certain room as it was dark and it felt like there was a invisible barrier. However the dream felt a bit dark, light wasn&rsquo;t that bright, the color of wall was not exactly how it was in real. I didn&rsquo;t see anyone it was just me.</p>
<p>Second time I failed and it was kind of scary and also disappointing. I did everything but I actually got stuck and couldn&rsquo;t move at all. I felt like a dark black colored human like thing cuddling with me. It sounds so nice as I nicely described but it wasn&rsquo;t so satisfying, hahaha. So yes, it was sleep paralysis. I&rsquo;ve encountered it several times in my life. Though that time it made so tired that when it got away I found myself sweating badly. I may have said something regarding this on the <a href="/images">image section of this site</a> about that.</p>
<p>look, how romantic it is!</p>

    <img src="/images/posts/lucid-dream/sleep-paralysis.jpg" alt="[Sleep-paralysis]" title="Sleep paralysis" style="width: 600px">

<p>Despite failing and going through a sleep paralysis, I tried once again. Though it wasn&rsquo;t quite like a lucid dream. Later I felt like It will be a waste of time for me so I then didn&rsquo;t try it anymore as it badly affected my sleep cycle.</p>
<h1 id="why-one-shouldnt-try-lucid-dreaming">Why one shouldn&rsquo;t try lucid dreaming?</h1>
<p>Well, if you have got a lot of time for sleeping, don&rsquo;t care about your mental health and want to explore your dreams more deeply then hell yeah, do it.</p>
<p>But if you got work and have to wake up early or you being a student, I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s not worth it. It&rsquo;s just a thing for people who have got a chance to sleep the next day away. Also it keeps bad impact on your health. Some people even fell way worse things than me. Just join this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming">subreddit</a>, here they share many things about lucid dreaming.</p>
<p>So that was all about LUCID DREAMING!</p>
