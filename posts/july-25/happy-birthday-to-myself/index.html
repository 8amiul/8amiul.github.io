	<div class="post-content"><p>Finally, I am 20! Not really excited but glad to come this far.</p>
<p>I never really celebrated my birthday in a grand manner. The last time I cut a cake, I was probably 10 years old. Yeah, 15 years ago. I never really felt like cutting cakes, blowing candles, getting gifts or anything else. All I wanted was just to be with my friends and family. As a kid I learned that people cut cakes on their birthday. I remembered I also did and I was happy too. Who doesn&rsquo;t like cakes, gifts and etc things? Once we had a party at our house. Maybe some of my cousins and friends were there. I don&rsquo;t remember how old I was. I must have been happy then.</p>
<p>Now birthdays are just a day where I know that in this day I was born. Still special dishes are made, my parents and sibling do wish me at 12 O&rsquo;clock just to make me happy. Just to show that they care about me and want to make me happy. When they wished me today, it felt so nice. I just thanked them. What more I could do. At least I&rsquo;ve got some people who care for me.</p>
<p>Last year, I don&rsquo;t remember what I did on my birthday. It was chaos everywhere in our country. Lived an isolated time and without internet. &ldquo;redacted&rdquo;</p>
<p>I appreciate those people who wished me today. You, just a few people, have made my day. I don&rsquo;t know how you got my birthday in your mind. That doesn&rsquo;t even matter. What matters is that you have remembered me and wished me today. I hope you get to fullfil your dreams and live a healthy and happy life.</p>
<p>Yeah, bit of a gloomy birthday I am having. I could be happy if I were not brining unwanted thoughts out of nowhere. I guess a sleep will get rid of those things that I am afraid of.</p>
