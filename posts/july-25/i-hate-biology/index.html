	<div class="post-content"><p>Another note is gonna, probably, make me fall asleep. Whenever I try to write something, I start feeling asleep. Thus, I say to myself that the topic can go to hell and why should I talk about it and I sleep. Hopefully, I will not be writing this note fully like all the other unpublished notes. Tonight, I don&rsquo;t have anything specific to talk about. It will be about what I am going through right now. Within a day, I will be attending the Biology exam. I never liked Biology and never wanted to learn because it is a pain to study biology in our curriculum.</p>
<p>Biology is a nice subject I will say. It&rsquo;s interesting when I study it willingly . But when the curriculum forces me to  memorize the reactions of photosynthesis and respiration, gymnosperms and angiosperms, all those diversities of species and every possible bullshit, It is unbearable. I am reluctant to study biology. I took it as an optional subject. Though, it is optional but it is rather more important than any other subjects cause it can increase points on those subjects where I may not get A+.</p>
<p>I have a tendency to not do something that I don&rsquo;t like. Manly which needs a lot of memorization. Math is also about memorization. Some say it isn&rsquo;t but at one point it is. All those formulas and types where we can&rsquo;t go further if we are unaware about any of these. But still math is enjoyable. Formulas can easily be memorized by writing it a few times. Even organic chemistry seems easier than biology. Sounds funny, right? But it&rsquo;s my perspective. I ain&rsquo;t a good student who&rsquo;s getting A+ this time but still it doesn&rsquo;t make me inept at determining the difficulties.</p>
<p>Yeah, hope this phase of Biology goes quick and obviously well. Later I&rsquo;ll have math to deal with. It won&rsquo;t be so exhausting like biology. I am not saying I am good with math but at least I have an interest in studying it. I am waiting till this thing ends. I would be happy if they didn&rsquo;t allot that much gap between exams. It sucks my energy badly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll be doing tomorrow. Problem, just going to accept the fate. Now just before the exam, now I don&rsquo;t have anything in mind. Pretty, tough situation. I wish there was nothing called society. If the society wasn&rsquo;t there to judge me by my results then probably students wouldn&rsquo;t be so terrified of getting poor marks. At least I can say that they wouldn&rsquo;t hang themselves. Not a big fan of suicide. Our society has to change their mindset. Maybe it will happen one day but it will take so many years.</p>
