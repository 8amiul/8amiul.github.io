	<div class="post-content"><p>It has been a long time since I posted on my site. I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to post today but something has made me write this note. I am irritated, frustrated, devastated and all the possible words here. It is 3 AM and still I am not sleeping perhaps now I would sleep after revising all the topics of chemistry. I was studying and suddenly I heard the news that we all, the HSC candidates, wanted to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations scheduled for today have been postponed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, at least it has been postponed. But at 3:00 AM? Just a few hours before the exam? Most of the students have already slept with a traumatize day passed and bare minimum preparation! What sort of fuckury it can be? How imperfect and unprofessional they can be! Could not they take wiser steps than showing hypocrisy and said this earlier? Sadly, even we claim that we have achieved the freedom of speech after sacrificing lives a year ago, but still can&rsquo;t be so judgemental. For what reason they became martyred? To get the freedom of speech, right? But do we still have the freedom of speech? If we had then I would not be using &ldquo;they&rdquo; instead of the exact word that I want to say. What if I say the word that I want? I will be vanished.</p>
<p>Today one of the worst catastrophes has occurred. Taking lives of many children. How many of them have been freed from this cruel country? Some say 20 some say 100. Who am I to believe? What makes me more upset is that they were just kids studying in class 3-4. Moreover, many other people also died with them. Most of them wanted to save those children. If they lived then those were to see the cruelty of us and our nation. A teacher burned herself just to save her students and then died. Friends burned their hands just to save each other. That&rsquo;s the only heroic act I currently can remember with sleep in my eyes. There are a lot of things to discuss about this incident. It was indeed terrific. Sorry, for not being so descriptive here cause my mind isn&rsquo;t really working. Whatever, there were kids in that class room, sitting on those benches, sadly they don&rsquo;t look human anymore and they left this cruel world and on their way to heaven. They didn&rsquo;t even get to react to the heat of a jet plane crash.</p>
<p>Look at their parents! How can they accept the murders of those innocent children? Yes, I said murder. A young Flight Lieutenant, a valuable soul of this country, is a victim to this incident too. He also got murdered along with those innocent people. I don&rsquo;t know what happened there and can&rsquo;t blindly blame him for this or won&rsquo;t even lionize blindly. Blaming him is not the smartest thing to do here. Either way he had to crash somewhere but I don&rsquo;t know why he had to crash into a school. Perhaps, it was fate! Yeah, that creates a confusion. And, this confusion will never be cleared as they will never disclose the actual truth!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anymore energy left after watching the incident and clownery of our nation. It is up to you to use your sense and judge here. The pointer points to use somehow. If you think deeply then you will know that we actually are the reason for this. We let it happen. We never stood against it before it could happen. We always protest when it goes wrong. We never worked to solve matters. We never raise concern before a disaster. We don&rsquo;t even implement after something goes wrong. We knew it would happen some day or at least they knew. But what changed? They let it happen and it has happened.</p>
<p>We never were good and never will be. We have never learned a lesson and will we ever?
We are meant to be oppressed. We are meant to be dead.</p>
<h1 id="update---072225-1100-am">UPDATE - 07/22/25 [11:00 AM]</h1>
<p>I just woke up and opened Facebook. I saw many things happening. Some students are enjoying like nothing happened yesterday as their demands were accepted. But some are also protesting and demanding the fulfillment of their 6 points.</p>
<p>I never was a big fan of writing things about our society. I believe it is a big waste of time. Cause no matter how loud you are nobody really gonna pay a heed to you. Bangladesh is a loop. I might sound like a hater of this country. But I guess I am not. I don&rsquo;t hate my country. It is a beautiful land but with disgusting people like me and us.</p>
<h3 id="so-things-in-short">So things in short</h3>
<p>-&gt; Due to the authorities fault many innocent people had to give their life
-&gt; Huge population visited that place like it is a tourist spot.
-&gt; Burned kid moving aimlessly as he got nobody to help him even where people were there but instead helping they chose to record him on phone
-&gt; 2L water bottle can even price up to 600 taka!
-&gt; Teachers, parents and many other people died to save those juveniles.
-&gt; Some people used this incident to fill their pockets
-&gt; One group is trying to reduce the accusations as much as possible
-&gt; I live in a country where a board exam hasn&rsquo;t still postponed even after the city faced a disaster
-&gt; Many more things I want to mention but I can&rsquo;t because nobody know what happens next.
-&gt; I didn&rsquo;t discuss this matter vastly so basing from my opinions one should not suppress the gravity of it.</p>
<p>Nah, I ain&rsquo;t gonna talk about our society anymore. We know what we are and we know what we will be. Just let it happen. Soon either a jet plane or better call it a &lsquo;ভাঙ্গারি&rsquo; will crash into me or I will be made disappeared like I never existed.</p>
<h1 id="another-update">Another Update</h1>
<p>The 6 points were accepted and they told student to leave the secretariat. in disguise of students there are many vicious people who wants to incarnate the previous regime. Thus they are taking the benefits by mixing with students and creating chaos. It nothing but ruins the image of students. Getting brainwashed many students are also taking their side. Another fight between the authority and the students. I don&rsquo;t know where this jet crash will lead us to. But I know tomorrow we will forget about what happened yesterday. That&rsquo;s how it works here.</p>
