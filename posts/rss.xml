      <title>Graphics Tablet on Linux</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/gfx-tablet-on-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 23:09:07 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/gfx-tablet-on-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So how easy it was to make the graphics tablet working on linux? I using Debian found it pretty straightforward! Oh, this tutorial is only for those who are using Xorg NOT WAYLAND!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;rsquo;s the same for all the distributions. As I am using Debian I will follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/&#34;&gt;Debian wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/WacomTablets&#34;&gt;WacomTablets page of the wiki&lt;/a&gt;, we get to see that a package is necessary to install for wacom tablets to work on xorg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might not have a tablet from Wacom, you might have something else. I am using the VEIKK S640. But this method should work for every tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d&lt;/code&gt; folder paste these few lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Section &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;InputClass&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    Identifier &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Tablet&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    Driver &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;wacom&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    MatchDevicePath &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/dev/input/event*&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    MatchUSBID &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;VID:PID&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;EndSection
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we are not done yet. We have to replace &lt;code&gt;VID:PID&lt;/code&gt; the with the actual id of the tablet. Let&amp;rsquo;s use the tool &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;~ % lsusb
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bus &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;006&lt;/span&gt; Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Found...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bus &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;005&lt;/span&gt; Device 002: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bus &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;003&lt;/span&gt; Device 002: ID 046d:c077 Logitech, Inc. Mouse
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bus &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;001&lt;/span&gt; Device 006: ID 2feb:0001 Beijing Veikk..
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So at the bottom of the output I have the &lt;code&gt;VID:PID&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;2feb:0001&lt;/code&gt;. Just replace it in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that restarting the xserver might make the tablet working.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is love? Baby don&#39;t hurt me... - Haddaway</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/oh-my-flower/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:33:44 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/oh-my-flower/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another blog it is! I&amp;rsquo;ll write about something that none of you may have expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in their life goes through it, and they sacrifice everything for it. They put a lot of efforts but does it actually help? Well, it depends. Some can make it and the rest move on. Move on with an intention to be better next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article that actually opened my mind. I am going through pretty bad time of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll say. I am no good writer who can encourage or motivate you, but I&amp;rsquo;ve something that can actually help you go through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll mark some lines from the article named &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/love&#34;&gt;Love Is Not Enough&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which is written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/about&#34;&gt;Mark Manson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he came up with this, but everyone should read it even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced the so-called love thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he started with two characters. One idealized love and another didn&amp;rsquo;t. Idealizing love means taking love as a solution to all of his problems. Thus, we experience that dark side of &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
And because we idealize love, we overestimate it. As a result, our relationships pay a price.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the article I found something called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/personal-values&#34;&gt;fundamental values&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; of love I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some hints were given such as respect, humility and commitment. We had a commitment which failed nicely. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t have those two things respect and humility. And yeah, we fought a lot. We blamed each other. Ruined day and nights. So messed up shit it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic relationships are kind of like a boat on emotions. Keep rowing, and suddenly it gets overwhelmed with emotions and both sink in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
After all, if love solves everything, then why bother with all the other stuff? all the hard stuff?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idealizing love causes unrealistic expectations about love. Let us dive in to three harsh truths about love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-does-not-equal-compatibility&#34;&gt;Love Does Not Equal Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Just because you fall in love with someone doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they?re a good partner for you to be with over the long term. Love is an &lt;b style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;emotional&lt;/b&gt; process. Compatibility is a &lt;b style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;logical&lt;/b&gt; process. And the two don&#39;t bleed into one another very well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s true. Did anyone say that if you love someone that means they are the perfect one for you? The article also mentions that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It&#39;s possible to fall in love with somebody who sucks for us and our happiness.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It&#39;s possible to fall in love with somebody who has different ambitions or life goals that are contradictory to our own, who holds different philosophical beliefs or worldviews that clash with our own sense of reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel the spark, and we jump and we fall. That&amp;rsquo;s how things work in a toxic relation. Then we consider that what went wrong? But what actually went wrong is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It went wrong before it even began.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not wrong to love someone, but we fail to understand the fundamental values of love that is mentioned in the article. We don&amp;rsquo;t value each other&amp;rsquo;s ambitions, thoughts and worldviews. We consider them to be like us. Thus forcing them to be one of us cause clashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-does-not-solve-your-relationship-problems&#34;&gt;Love Does Not Solve Your Relationship Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found a comment on Reddit that said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re ever walking in the woods, and you see the same tree twice, you&amp;rsquo;re lost son&amp;rdquo; was the best relationship advice my grandpa told me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked it. That actually clarifies that if a relationship fails once it will hardly succeed. Obviously there are exceptions but let&amp;rsquo;s talk about majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So talking in emotions make problems look like they are solvable but in reality it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Keep doing the same thing such as patching it again then getting hurt is just an absolute truth in those relationships that failed once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who actually think logically on those times? Nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we should learn is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
While love may make you feel better about your relationship problems, it doesn&#39;t actually solve any of your relationship problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-is-not-always-worth-sacrificing-yourself-for&#34;&gt;Love Is Not Always Worth Sacrificing Yourself For&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsession is a pretty bad thing. Obsession leads you to addiction. Addiction is way worse. When we love someone in a crazy sense it will eventually fail. Cause there will be questions in your mind that why I am not getting what I give, I don&amp;rsquo;t get the same love, I treat them well but do they? And many other questions will rise like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If respecting each other if one still gets this questions then yes maybe they are not the right person for you. I believe why wasting time like this? You give love, in return you get nothing. Then why still be there? Be there because of addiction or the hell called obsession. If you one wants to unfuck a relation then fuck the obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
In loving relationships, it&#39;s normal for both people to occasionally sacrifice their own desires, their own needs, and their own time for one another. I would argue that this is normal and healthy and a big part of what makes a relationship so great.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What love it is if you don&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
But when it comes to sacrificing one&#39;s self-respect, one&#39;s dignity, one&#39;s physical body, one&#39;s ambitions and life purpose, just to be with someone, then that same love becomes problematic.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&#34;color:rgb(226, 108, 216);  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
A loving relationship is supposed to supplement our individual identity, not damage it or replace it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we still tolerate those damages that we both make just for the sake of love and affection, or I&amp;rsquo;ll say obsession. We fail to differentiate love and obsession. Whatever I shall make another post about obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we keep holding it then we will allow ruining our self-respect and image. This way our energy will get sucked which we don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the part that actually I needed which is &lt;em&gt;The Friendship Test&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts from the article says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
One of the oldest pieces of relationship advice in the book is, &lt;p style=&#34;color: gray;&#34;&gt;You and your partner should be best friends.?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt; Most people look at that piece of advice in the positive: I should spend time with my partner like I do with my best friend, I should communicate openly with my partner like I do with my best friend, I should have fun with my partner like I do with my best friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But people should also look at it in the negative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color:rgb(226, 108, 216);  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Would you tolerate your partner&#39;s negative behaviors in your best friend?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I answer then obviously not. With friends, I am not afraid of saying any bullshit. They ought to accept my dark humour, stupidity, fun and jokes whatsoever. I&amp;rsquo;ll be open to them. A friend is made with trust so love is. But if you can&amp;rsquo;t do the same with your partner then what freedom you get? At the end of the day you have to be with your friends just to share something that makes both of you laugh. Well, obviously we should be respectful then treat our loved ones a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our partner should be our best friend but being in the boundary I believe. Being open and less judgemental is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Why do we tolerate behavior in our romantic relationships that we would never ever, ever tolerate in our friendships?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy answer is that we are in love that&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final thing to remember,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
The only way you can fully enjoy the love in your life is to choose to make something else more important in your life than love.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, love is a nice thing to experience. Loving someone isn&amp;rsquo;t bad. We can fall in love on those who might be bad for use even good for us. But we should not be sacrificing these few things such as self-respect, dignity, ability to trust because they are hard to get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should let go. Not think that we won&amp;rsquo;t get someone like them in our life again. Be happy. Get indulged in sadness. Let us feel the pain. It is a lesson. Oh! I should mention something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you read this masterpiece? A book called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/The%20Subtle%20Art%20of%20Not%20Giving%20a%20Fck%20A%20Counterintuitive%20Approach%20to%20Living%20a%20Good%20Life%20by%20Mark%20Manson%20(z-lib.org).pdf&#34;&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; You can buy if you want. But a direct PDF link is attached here. I&amp;rsquo;ll highly suggest reading this book. It covers a lot of lessons that one must be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me taking a nap helps a lot. Getting busy is the solution. Replacing never should be a solution cause now you seek attention, now you seek the cure of your loneliness not love. Write like me. Keep notes, it helps. We should not love those who don&amp;rsquo;t love us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time is the only cure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img class=&#34;post-center-image&#34; src=&#34;https://8amiul.github.io/images/fire_writing.gif&#34; alt=&#34;[Fire writing]&#34; title=&#34;Fire writing&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I should stop writing. If you have read all of these from the beginning I thank you very much. I write blog posts just to spend my time, and it feels better to express my thoughts. Who cares whether someone has read it or not. Self-satisfaction i&amp;rsquo;ll say. At least I can fill that &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; page with something. Post which is huge like this looks cool though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Something sweet</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/something-sweet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 22:47:21 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/something-sweet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ate something different. A different recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve found. Last time I cooked noodles and now I present you this! I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know what to name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was starving and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the time to go out and bring something. I thought why not try something new with what I have within my reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten this kind of food before. That brown juice kind of thing is from date. The ingredients are actually,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bread slices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date Juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powdered Milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banana slices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just mixed these and I could add some more stuff if I had. I found these things near so I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother thinking of adding more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may try this if you are curious or like to try weird or different foods.
It tasted good. However I don&amp;rsquo;t really like sweets and foods that has sugar. But it was not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript is fun</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/javascript-is-fun/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 22:43:24 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/javascript-is-fun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of JavaScript. But later I realized that JS is so necessary for front-end web development. I recently just implemented an image viewer kind of page in my website, which needed JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know about JavaScript yet. There is a part of JavaScript
that connects it&amp;rsquo;s functionality with HTML and CSS, that is called Document Object Model aka DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax is a bit like C. As I am comfortable with C so JavaScript is also not really giving me much pain. But it is way more bigger than C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of programming languages are the same. You&amp;rsquo;ll have variable, loops, arrays, different kind of data types, functions, libraries to make life easier, OOP (maybe) and&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s all ig. So I am just learning the syntax and as well as some new features that come across while implementing more things in my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to mention few resources which I found helpful,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://javascript.info/&#34;&gt;javascript.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript&#34;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys&#34;&gt;A YouTube video for DOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://chatgpt.com&#34;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think learning by making a project does work better than following a tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>rss feed!</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/rss/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;rss feed is like a magazine where you can link many favourite webpages which provides a rss.xml thing. So with that you can view all the main contents of those websites without visiting every site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about rss feeds before building this site. I knew that icon on blog pages but never understood what actually rss was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my site also got a rss feed. Hugo, yes that&amp;rsquo;s what I used to generate this static site of mine. So hugo auto generates a rss.xml file that contains everything we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a problem at first. By default it wasn&amp;rsquo;t set up properly. On the rss reader my site wasn&amp;rsquo;t rendered correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to fix this I had to implement a code in hugo&amp;rsquo;s mytheme/layouts/_default/rss.xml. Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to understand that code.
It works for me, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get executed in my system and once again it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gideonwolfe.com/posts/sysadmin/hugo/hugorss/&#34;&gt;Code can be found here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder&#34;&gt;feeder&lt;/a&gt; on my phone and on linux I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat&#34;&gt;newsboat&lt;/a&gt; to view rss feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First meal of 2025</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/first_meal_2025/</link>

      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/first_meal_2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just cooked my first meal of this year. So it&amp;rsquo;s a new year and Today I woke up early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just thought it&amp;rsquo;s better I try something new today. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I make my own breakfast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noodles was the only food I knew how to cook. So I started cooking. I took  noodles, then egg and some veggies (actually left over salad from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s party).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cooked properly. But still it looked so good. But as I didn&amp;rsquo;t put salt or any other spices, it tasted&amp;hellip; okay. Not the best but one who starving will obviously eat.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img class=&#34;post-center-image&#34; src=&#34;https://8amiul.github.io/images/noodles.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Noodles Image]&#34; title=&#34;Nooooodles&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it looking good. I wish I could make it more tasty. But I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make it any other day. Making my own breakfast was fun. But time consuming. It gives pleasure. We should try making our own food. Getting up early may also be another reason that made cooking breakfast so fun. The morning light and air is so so pure and refreshing. For me winter morning is the best!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodlock</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/goodlock/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 14:14:53 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/goodlock/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My phone has One Ui 4.1 core. Which is crap! None of the GoodLock modules are supported on my phone. But with some tweaking we can achieve this feature. But the phone has to be rooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our First aim is to download the patched version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://downloads.corsicanu.ro/GoodLock/&#34; title=&#34;GoodLock&#34;&gt;GoodLock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have to disable the apk signature verification check. Why do we need that? Just because those apk doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with any signature. But our system looks for one.
So that&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to install,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riru magisk module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riru Lsposed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;core patch (which is a Lsposed module).
After this we will be able to install the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing it with the android package manager won&amp;rsquo;t work unfortunately. You need SAI or Split APKs Installer. You can find it in Google PlayStore. Use SAI to install the apk. Also don&amp;rsquo;t forget to set the installer mode to rooted mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable Sign APKs option in SAI. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky then you will be able to open those programs at first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it shows &lt;code&gt;unsupported version&lt;/code&gt; then. You need to take some more steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we have to install Lucky Patcher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then install Lucky Patcher module in Lsposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside it go to Toolbox Patch to android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There select first three options. Most probably they will be,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signature verification status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable signature verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable signature verification in the package manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two of them will be selected by Lsposed. You just have to select the third one. Then click apply. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to restart your phone lest you might not get to see the changes at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through all of these steps I was able to install most of the GoodLock modules.&lt;/p&gt;
