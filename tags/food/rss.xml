      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ate something different. A different recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve found. Last time I cooked noodles and now I present you this! I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know what to name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was starving and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the time to go out and bring something. I thought why not try something new with what I have within my reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten this kind of food before. That brown juice kind of thing is from date. The ingredients are actually,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bread slices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date Juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powdered Milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banana slices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just mixed these and I could add some more stuff if I had. I found these things near so I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother thinking of adding more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may try this if you are curious or like to try weird or different foods.
It tasted good. However I don&amp;rsquo;t really like sweets and foods that has sugar. But it was not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First meal of 2025</title>

    .post-content img, .post-content a img {
        align-self: center;
        max-width: 100%; 
        width: 1000px; 
        height: auto; 
        padding: 0.5rem 1rem 0.5rem 1rem;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just cooked my first meal of this year. So it&amp;rsquo;s a new year and Today I woke up early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just thought it&amp;rsquo;s better I try something new today. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I make my own breakfast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noodles was the only food I knew how to cook. So I started cooking. I took  noodles, then egg and some veggies (actually left over salad from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s party).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cooked properly. But still it looked so good. But as I didn&amp;rsquo;t put salt or any other spices, it tasted&amp;hellip; okay. Not the best but one who starving will obviously eat.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img class=&#34;post-center-image&#34; src=&#34;https://8amiul.github.io/images/noodles.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Noodles Image]&#34; title=&#34;Nooooodles&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it looking good. I wish I could make it more tasty. But I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make it any other day. Making my own breakfast was fun. But time consuming. It gives pleasure. We should try making our own food. Getting up early may also be another reason that made cooking breakfast so fun. The morning light and air is so so pure and refreshing. For me winter morning is the best!&lt;/p&gt;
