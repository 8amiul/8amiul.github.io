      <title>Thoughts on Recent Exams</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently made a post about my sufferings due to biology exam. Surprisingly it went nice. Perhaps I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the person who deserved such smooth exam. I was quite unsure of that exam as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the will to study. All praise to the almighty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides everything, I was confident with my math exam. Because I thought I like to solve problems. I can stick with a problem until I solve it, I have that patience. But sadly this type of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t get that much value here in this type of exams or in any exams. Exam is not only about solving problems by thinking critically. Here one has a limited time and within that time one must answer those. Otherwise you be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that I could solve problems but just only when I am in my room lying in my bed. If you live in Bangladesh and keep knowledge about the students. Then you might already heard that, this year questions are a bit weird. By saying weird I mean that something we didn&amp;rsquo;t expected. Everyone thought that like every year boards will follow the trend. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t happened so nicely this year. They chose randomness and they did it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not blame the board for making such questions. If I do, then I clearly trying to blame others for my inability. I am not trying to be so different than others by stating such fact. I don&amp;rsquo;t even care wether they make questions difficult or easy as I don&amp;rsquo;t really count this exam so fancy thing in my life. Society might consider it as a valuable exam but does this exam even justify anything of a student?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify the full potential of a human or a student. It might give you a preliminary idea about a person. Sometimes that idea even goes wrong. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen countless people those who didn&amp;rsquo;t do well in HSC but still they are living a good life. They are brilliant and they are no lesser than any other talented students. Now let us get back to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, questions were so freaking difficult. Not everyone could answer it properly. Those who are talented students, they could only answer those. Then would get A+. However, in this way, we can exclude people those who doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve an A+. Thus, we can normalize the fact that getting 4.69 isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad result. Consider only 60 people got A+ in Dhaka board. Then will our parents and the society gonna compare all of us with those 60 people? If they do then it will be pathetic. I believe they will not do. But if 70% students get A+ and the rest can not, then definitely there will be people to say why you weren&amp;rsquo;t in that 70%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my POV and with my ignorance, I&amp;rsquo;ll say that questions were easy for those who studied. I didn&amp;rsquo;t study so I must not find it easy. If I had studied I would have found it easier. This is the fact here. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to blame the other for my failure. Today it was the worst HSC exam I have ever attended! But still I have that strength to subdue the sadness that occurs or the tendency of blaming others for my own failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I hate studying biology</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/july-25/i-hate-biology/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 18:41:48 +0600</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another note is gonna, probably, make me fall asleep. Whenever I try to write something, I start feeling asleep. Thus, I say to myself that the topic can go to hell and why should I talk about it and I sleep. Hopefully, I will not be writing this note fully like all the other unpublished notes. Tonight, I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything specific to talk about. It will be about what I am going through right now. Within a day, I will be attending the Biology exam. I never liked Biology and never wanted to learn because it is a pain to study biology in our curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology is a nice subject I will say. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting when I study it willingly . But when the curriculum forces me to  memorize the reactions of photosynthesis and respiration, gymnosperms and angiosperms, all those diversities of species and every possible bullshit, It is unbearable. I am reluctant to study biology. I took it as an optional subject. Though, it is optional but it is rather more important than any other subjects cause it can increase points on those subjects where I may not get A+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a tendency to not do something that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. Manly which needs a lot of memorization. Math is also about memorization. Some say it isn&amp;rsquo;t but at one point it is. All those formulas and types where we can&amp;rsquo;t go further if we are unaware about any of these. But still math is enjoyable. Formulas can easily be memorized by writing it a few times. Even organic chemistry seems easier than biology. Sounds funny, right? But it&amp;rsquo;s my perspective. I ain&amp;rsquo;t a good student who&amp;rsquo;s getting A+ this time but still it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me inept at determining the difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, hope this phase of Biology goes quick and obviously well. Later I&amp;rsquo;ll have math to deal with. It won&amp;rsquo;t be so exhausting like biology. I am not saying I am good with math but at least I have an interest in studying it. I am waiting till this thing ends. I would be happy if they didn&amp;rsquo;t allot that much gap between exams. It sucks my energy badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing tomorrow. Problem, just going to accept the fate. Now just before the exam, now I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything in mind. Pretty, tough situation. I wish there was nothing called society. If the society wasn&amp;rsquo;t there to judge me by my results then probably students wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so terrified of getting poor marks. At least I can say that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hang themselves. Not a big fan of suicide. Our society has to change their mindset. Maybe it will happen one day but it will take so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&#34;https://8amiul.github.io/posts/may-25/awful-day/&#34;&gt;Awful day&lt;/a&gt; incarcerated!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fuck the System</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/july-25/fuck-the-system/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 04:05:53 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/july-25/fuck-the-system/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time since I posted on my site. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to post today but something has made me write this note. I am irritated, frustrated, devastated and all the possible words here. It is 3 AM and still I am not sleeping perhaps now I would sleep after revising all the topics of chemistry. I was studying and suddenly I heard the news that we all, the HSC candidates, wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations scheduled for today have been postponed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least it has been postponed. But at 3:00 AM? Just a few hours before the exam? Most of the students have already slept with a traumatize day passed and bare minimum preparation! What sort of fuckury it can be? How imperfect and unprofessional they can be! Could not they take wiser steps than showing hypocrisy and said this earlier? Sadly, even we claim that we have achieved the freedom of speech after sacrificing lives a year ago, but still can&amp;rsquo;t be so judgemental. For what reason they became martyred? To get the freedom of speech, right? But do we still have the freedom of speech? If we had then I would not be using &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; instead of the exact word that I want to say. What if I say the word that I want? I will be vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today one of the worst catastrophes has occurred. Taking lives of many children. How many of them have been freed from this cruel country? Some say 20 some say 100. Who am I to believe? What makes me more upset is that they were just kids studying in class 3-4. Moreover, many other people also died with them. Most of them wanted to save those children. If they lived then those were to see the cruelty of us and our nation. A teacher burned herself just to save her students and then died. Friends burned their hands just to save each other. That&amp;rsquo;s the only heroic act I currently can remember with sleep in my eyes. There are a lot of things to discuss about this incident. It was indeed terrific. Sorry, for not being so descriptive here cause my mind isn&amp;rsquo;t really working. Whatever, there were kids in that class room, sitting on those benches, sadly they don&amp;rsquo;t look human anymore and they left this cruel world and on their way to heaven. They didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to react to the heat of a jet plane crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at their parents! How can they accept the murders of those innocent children? Yes, I said murder. A young Flight Lieutenant, a valuable soul of this country, is a victim to this incident too. He also got murdered along with those innocent people. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened there and can&amp;rsquo;t blindly blame him for this or won&amp;rsquo;t even lionize blindly. Blaming him is not the smartest thing to do here. Either way he had to crash somewhere but I don&amp;rsquo;t know why he had to crash into a school. Perhaps, it was fate! Yeah, that creates a confusion. And, this confusion will never be cleared as they will never disclose the actual truth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anymore energy left after watching the incident and clownery of our nation. It is up to you to use your sense and judge here. The pointer points to use somehow. If you think deeply then you will know that we actually are the reason for this. We let it happen. We never stood against it before it could happen. We always protest when it goes wrong. We never worked to solve matters. We never raise concern before a disaster. We don&amp;rsquo;t even implement after something goes wrong. We knew it would happen some day or at least they knew. But what changed? They let it happen and it has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never were good and never will be. We have never learned a lesson and will we ever?
We are meant to be oppressed. We are meant to be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;update---072225-1100-am&#34;&gt;UPDATE - 07/22/25 [11:00 AM]&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just woke up and opened Facebook. I saw many things happening. Some students are enjoying like nothing happened yesterday as their demands were accepted. But some are also protesting and demanding the fulfillment of their 6 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never was a big fan of writing things about our society. I believe it is a big waste of time. Cause no matter how loud you are nobody really gonna pay a heed to you. Bangladesh is a loop. I might sound like a hater of this country. But I guess I am not. I don&amp;rsquo;t hate my country. It is a beautiful land but with disgusting people like me and us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-things-in-short&#34;&gt;So things in short&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; Due to the authorities fault many innocent people had to give their life
-&amp;gt; Huge population visited that place like it is a tourist spot.
-&amp;gt; Burned kid moving aimlessly as he got nobody to help him even where people were there but instead helping they chose to record him on phone
-&amp;gt; 2L water bottle can even price up to 600 taka!
-&amp;gt; Teachers, parents and many other people died to save those juveniles.
-&amp;gt; Some people used this incident to fill their pockets
-&amp;gt; One group is trying to reduce the accusations as much as possible
-&amp;gt; I live in a country where a board exam hasn&amp;rsquo;t still postponed even after the city faced a disaster
-&amp;gt; Many more things I want to mention but I can&amp;rsquo;t because nobody know what happens next.
-&amp;gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t discuss this matter vastly so basing from my opinions one should not suppress the gravity of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah, I ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna talk about our society anymore. We know what we are and we know what we will be. Just let it happen. Soon either a jet plane or better call it a &amp;lsquo;ভাঙ্গারি&amp;rsquo; will crash into me or I will be made disappeared like I never existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;another-update&#34;&gt;Another Update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6 points were accepted and they told student to leave the secretariat. in disguise of students there are many vicious people who wants to incarnate the previous regime. Thus they are taking the benefits by mixing with students and creating chaos. It nothing but ruins the image of students. Getting brainwashed many students are also taking their side. Another fight between the authority and the students. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where this jet crash will lead us to. But I know tomorrow we will forget about what happened yesterday. That&amp;rsquo;s how it works here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happiness</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/jun-25/happiness/</link>

      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/jun-25/happiness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it. Maybe&amp;hellip; one day&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll add more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to save daily realizations and things I go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I accept the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ll get what I deserve. [26/06/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I accept my limits and capabilities that I was not willing to alter. [29/06/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I trust my gut and make my own decision to face its consequence. [01/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I can let things go and assume my next step. [04/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I sleep the reminiscence away.  [06/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I implement my ideas on their ideas to perfectionate it for myself. [08/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough realizations for now. [27/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Did I have a cold drink that day?</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/may-25/cold-drink/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:27:39 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/may-25/cold-drink/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;rsquo;t remember. It was a year ago. I just got into college. Traveling was so tiring for me and, I believe, for everyone living in Dhaka. That enormous traffic and pollution was enough to put myself down. I was new to college, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the best route to reach there. I used to travel by bus. Which wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best way of traveling. But at least the way it was, which I knew at that time. Then days passed, and I found another path, which has its own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So about cold drinks, I used to become so thirsty as I had to walk a lot. I would crave something cold. I mostly wanted a nice lemonade. I could have a simple one from a roadside vendor, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so tasteful. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of hygiene. But it&amp;rsquo;s not like I haven&amp;rsquo;t had lemonade from them. I had quite a lot. I used to go to college with one of my friends. We had to walk a lot; we sometimes stopped to get a lemonade. It actually attracts us to go there. Humidity and tiredness would make us want something cold. Also, it looks so nice to see lemons, ice cubes, and people drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually tasty. I saw how they make it. It&amp;rsquo;s so simple and fast. What they do is just add a little lemon, obviously water, and ice cubes. Nobody knows about its origin. Those ice cubes can even be from the morgue; who cares? All I want is temporary satisfaction. So ice cubes and an unknown recipe looked like salt. Some kind of mixture it was. Then mix it and serve. Quite easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking that would satisfy me, but it would make me a bit more exhausted. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. I know it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the case, but it happens to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn, that was a long road and quite a hassle. Getting on a bus and having a seat was an amazing challenge at that time. I have made a lot of bad choices in my life. One of them was choosing a college that was 9 km far from my home. It might not be a huge distance for people around the world. But here it is a great distance. Time is a valuable thing. Taking decisions like this costs both energy and time. So it means it was just nothing but ruining a beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have passed those days. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to college anymore. I have a bigger challenge. Maybe when I&amp;rsquo;m in university I&amp;rsquo;ll have to go through this kind of hassle once again. That&amp;rsquo;s how it works here, right? Or maybe everywhere. Suffering is everywhere; suffering is for everyone. One suffers through poverty and another through abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how was life back then? I thought I had enough time for everything. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know or never tried to understand that time flies so fast. I had a lot of dreams to fulfill. A different ambition, different mindset, different companionship, and different future assumptions. Now I am standing at this date, and I see everything so differently. It didn&amp;rsquo;t go according to my assumptions or plans. It&amp;rsquo;s not the worst, though, but a lot of things have changed, and I am trying my best to get adjusted to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a huge post I&amp;rsquo;ve written that goes with my life. Not a very great life-changing speech it is. But why must we always seek motivation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let me mention some of the realizations that I&amp;rsquo;ve made and end this shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept unexpected consequences and changes in life because it&amp;rsquo;s an uncertain simulation of the creator of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s replacement is on the way, and when the replacement arrives, one may replace it with no remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s flower may become tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s thorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a nap and drinking enough water can sometimes be a solution to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major decisions should be taken in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take less stress and be optimistic, because life is what you make it. It is painful if you see one better than you, and it is joyous if the better one is you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, people will try to suck your blood, but you gotta point them toward somewhere else of you so they can suck that instead. (ifykyk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to post, so I did post my thoughts here. It might not help you, but it helps me. We have nothing in our control. We neither can control us nor them. What we have in control is our judgment. How do we accept and how do we not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is love? Baby don&#39;t hurt me... - Haddaway</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/oh-my-flower/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:33:44 +0600</pubDate>

    .post-content img, .post-content a img {
        align-self: center;
        max-width: 100%; 
        width: 1000px; 
        height: auto; 
        padding: 0.5rem 1rem 0.5rem 1rem;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another blog it is! I&amp;rsquo;ll write about something that none of you may have expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in their life goes through it, and they sacrifice everything for it. They put a lot of efforts but does it actually help? Well, it depends. Some can make it and the rest move on. Move on with an intention to be better next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article that actually opened my mind. I am going through pretty bad time of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll say. I am no good writer who can encourage or motivate you, but I&amp;rsquo;ve something that can actually help you go through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll mark some lines from the article named &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/love&#34;&gt;Love Is Not Enough&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which is written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/about&#34;&gt;Mark Manson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he came up with this, but everyone should read it even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced the so-called love thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he started with two characters. One idealized love and another didn&amp;rsquo;t. Idealizing love means taking love as a solution to all of his problems. Thus, we experience that dark side of &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
And because we idealize love, we overestimate it. As a result, our relationships pay a price.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the article I found something called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/personal-values&#34;&gt;fundamental values&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; of love I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some hints were given such as respect, humility and commitment. We had a commitment which failed nicely. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t have those two things respect and humility. And yeah, we fought a lot. We blamed each other. Ruined day and nights. So messed up shit it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic relationships are kind of like a boat on emotions. Keep rowing, and suddenly it gets overwhelmed with emotions and both sink in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
After all, if love solves everything, then why bother with all the other stuff? all the hard stuff?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idealizing love causes unrealistic expectations about love. Let us dive in to three harsh truths about love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-does-not-equal-compatibility&#34;&gt;Love Does Not Equal Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Just because you fall in love with someone doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they?re a good partner for you to be with over the long term. Love is an &lt;b style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;emotional&lt;/b&gt; process. Compatibility is a &lt;b style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;logical&lt;/b&gt; process. And the two don&#39;t bleed into one another very well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s true. Did anyone say that if you love someone that means they are the perfect one for you? The article also mentions that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It&#39;s possible to fall in love with somebody who sucks for us and our happiness.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It&#39;s possible to fall in love with somebody who has different ambitions or life goals that are contradictory to our own, who holds different philosophical beliefs or worldviews that clash with our own sense of reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel the spark, and we jump and we fall. That&amp;rsquo;s how things work in a toxic relation. Then we consider that what went wrong? But what actually went wrong is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It went wrong before it even began.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not wrong to love someone, but we fail to understand the fundamental values of love that is mentioned in the article. We don&amp;rsquo;t value each other&amp;rsquo;s ambitions, thoughts and worldviews. We consider them to be like us. Thus forcing them to be one of us cause clashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-does-not-solve-your-relationship-problems&#34;&gt;Love Does Not Solve Your Relationship Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found a comment on Reddit that said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re ever walking in the woods, and you see the same tree twice, you&amp;rsquo;re lost son&amp;rdquo; was the best relationship advice my grandpa told me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked it. That actually clarifies that if a relationship fails once it will hardly succeed. Obviously there are exceptions but let&amp;rsquo;s talk about majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So talking in emotions make problems look like they are solvable but in reality it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Keep doing the same thing such as patching it again then getting hurt is just an absolute truth in those relationships that failed once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who actually think logically on those times? Nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we should learn is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
While love may make you feel better about your relationship problems, it doesn&#39;t actually solve any of your relationship problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-is-not-always-worth-sacrificing-yourself-for&#34;&gt;Love Is Not Always Worth Sacrificing Yourself For&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsession is a pretty bad thing. Obsession leads you to addiction. Addiction is way worse. When we love someone in a crazy sense it will eventually fail. Cause there will be questions in your mind that why I am not getting what I give, I don&amp;rsquo;t get the same love, I treat them well but do they? And many other questions will rise like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If respecting each other if one still gets this questions then yes maybe they are not the right person for you. I believe why wasting time like this? You give love, in return you get nothing. Then why still be there? Be there because of addiction or the hell called obsession. If you one wants to unfuck a relation then fuck the obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
In loving relationships, it&#39;s normal for both people to occasionally sacrifice their own desires, their own needs, and their own time for one another. I would argue that this is normal and healthy and a big part of what makes a relationship so great.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What love it is if you don&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
But when it comes to sacrificing one&#39;s self-respect, one&#39;s dignity, one&#39;s physical body, one&#39;s ambitions and life purpose, just to be with someone, then that same love becomes problematic.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&#34;color:rgb(226, 108, 216);  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
A loving relationship is supposed to supplement our individual identity, not damage it or replace it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we still tolerate those damages that we both make just for the sake of love and affection, or I&amp;rsquo;ll say obsession. We fail to differentiate love and obsession. Whatever I shall make another post about obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we keep holding it then we will allow ruining our self-respect and image. This way our energy will get sucked which we don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the part that actually I needed which is &lt;em&gt;The Friendship Test&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts from the article says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
One of the oldest pieces of relationship advice in the book is, &lt;p style=&#34;color: gray;&#34;&gt;You and your partner should be best friends.?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt; Most people look at that piece of advice in the positive: I should spend time with my partner like I do with my best friend, I should communicate openly with my partner like I do with my best friend, I should have fun with my partner like I do with my best friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But people should also look at it in the negative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color:rgb(226, 108, 216);  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Would you tolerate your partner&#39;s negative behaviors in your best friend?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I answer then obviously not. With friends, I am not afraid of saying any bullshit. They ought to accept my dark humour, stupidity, fun and jokes whatsoever. I&amp;rsquo;ll be open to them. A friend is made with trust so love is. But if you can&amp;rsquo;t do the same with your partner then what freedom you get? At the end of the day you have to be with your friends just to share something that makes both of you laugh. Well, obviously we should be respectful then treat our loved ones a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our partner should be our best friend but being in the boundary I believe. Being open and less judgemental is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Why do we tolerate behavior in our romantic relationships that we would never ever, ever tolerate in our friendships?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy answer is that we are in love that&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final thing to remember,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
The only way you can fully enjoy the love in your life is to choose to make something else more important in your life than love.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, love is a nice thing to experience. Loving someone isn&amp;rsquo;t bad. We can fall in love on those who might be bad for use even good for us. But we should not be sacrificing these few things such as self-respect, dignity, ability to trust because they are hard to get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should let go. Not think that we won&amp;rsquo;t get someone like them in our life again. Be happy. Get indulged in sadness. Let us feel the pain. It is a lesson. Oh! I should mention something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you read this masterpiece? A book called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/The%20Subtle%20Art%20of%20Not%20Giving%20a%20Fck%20A%20Counterintuitive%20Approach%20to%20Living%20a%20Good%20Life%20by%20Mark%20Manson%20(z-lib.org).pdf&#34;&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; You can buy if you want. But a direct PDF link is attached here. I&amp;rsquo;ll highly suggest reading this book. It covers a lot of lessons that one must be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me taking a nap helps a lot. Getting busy is the solution. Replacing never should be a solution cause now you seek attention, now you seek the cure of your loneliness not love. Write like me. Keep notes, it helps. We should not love those who don&amp;rsquo;t love us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time is the only cure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img class=&#34;post-center-image&#34; src=&#34;https://8amiul.github.io/images/fire_writing.gif&#34; alt=&#34;[Fire writing]&#34; title=&#34;Fire writing&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I should stop writing. If you have read all of these from the beginning I thank you very much. I write blog posts just to spend my time, and it feels better to express my thoughts. Who cares whether someone has read it or not. Self-satisfaction i&amp;rsquo;ll say. At least I can fill that &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; page with something. Post which is huge like this looks cool though.&lt;/p&gt;
