      <title>Yet Another Piece of Note</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/sep-25/yet-another-piece-of-note/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last few months taught me a lot of things. Like always, I observed a lot of acts of people. I wanted to see how people really act and react in several situations. I tried my best to be polite and be a nice guy. I would not directly mention who they are or how I met them, rather I would talk about some different things&amp;hellip; Would like to tell me, about what to do and what not to do. These are my thoughts and it is up to you either to accept or to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-to-give-advicemotivation-to-someone&#34;&gt;When to give advice/motivation to someone?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realized that, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be providing advices without being asked. I know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound good but do you even know that the other person is ready to accept your advice?  Consuming overwhelming advices can make someone freaked out. I have gone through one recently. Despite my wil to hear, I still continued to grasp all of those, just because I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to call me rude. I could politely handle it, but I try not to argue with those who thinks they know everything. It hurts my ear but still I bear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should not be continuously giving advices to someone who you don&amp;rsquo;t have proper connection with. Even when we are close, we should think before saying something. Saying a thing once is good, twice.. okay fine. But the same thing again and again! Difficult to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;think-about-everything-react-to-few-things&#34;&gt;Think about everything, react to few things&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the title mentions, we necessarily don&amp;rsquo;t need to react to every thing around us. Perhaps, think of it first. Then maybe choose to react. I saw people who thinks that they must need to stand with one side at least. But what if we don&amp;rsquo;t consider it necessary to bother with? I could bring more controversial debate but let us not hurt anyone&amp;rsquo;s butt here. So pineapple on pizza or not? I will consider that I don&amp;rsquo;t eat pizza (for the sake of this example). So now, do I really need to react to this question? It is baseless for me as I don&amp;rsquo;t eat pizza. So just reject the question in way a you prefer. Though I like to eat pizza but still it is not really needed to even think of it. Also, I can add a bit extra, in life the more decision one makes, the more consequences he faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dont-show-your-covert-superioritynarcissism&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t show your covert superiority/narcissism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what amusement one gets buy making themselves the perpetrator. Whoever I talk to, they claim they are the evil and I am the good guy. Another case, I asked someone how he/she was and they replied that they are so evil and evil people live happy. Holy moly! This kinda things make me say like &amp;lsquo;Who the fuck starts a conversation like that! I just sat down.&amp;rsquo; It is a quite common disorder in our generation, I will say. They always act like they are the worst human being alive and they show that they are improving but hardly they improve, more likely to express their superiority in disguise. So I think, when we feel that we could be better, then we should be expressing it a different way where we sound like we actually mean it and don&amp;rsquo;t exaggerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this was it. I guess I mentioned just a few. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall everything now. Maybe in future I will mention more of those things. In life we should learn and apply first then maybe think of resolving others and only then actualizing the thoughts of resolving others (Optional). Also, thinking and actualizing is different, in case one missed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on Recent Exams</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/aug-25/thoughts-on-recent-exams/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:13:55 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/aug-25/thoughts-on-recent-exams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently made a post about my sufferings due to biology exam. Surprisingly, it went nice. Perhaps I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the person who deserved such a smooth exam. I was quite unsure of that exam as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the will to study. All praise to the almighty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides everything, I was confident with my math exam. Because, I thought I liked to solve problems. I can stick with a problem until I solve it, I have that patience. But sadly this type of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t get that much value here in this exam or in any exams. Exam is not only about solving problems by thinking critically. Here one has a limited time and within that time one must answer those. Otherwise you be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that I could solve problems but just only when I am in my room lying in my bed. If you live in Bangladesh and keep knowledge about the students. Then you might have already heard that, this year questions are a bit weird. By saying weird I mean that something we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see. Everyone thought that, like every year, boards would follow the trend. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t happened so nicely this year. They chose randomness and they did it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not blame the board for making such questions. If I do, then I clearly trying to blame others for my lacking. I am not trying to be so different than others by stating such fact. I don&amp;rsquo;t even care wether they make questions difficult or easy as I don&amp;rsquo;t really count this exam so fancy phenomena in my life. Society might consider it as a valuable exam but does this exam even justify anything of a student?  Well, I am scared of the society as they will criticize and marginalize me if I fail to do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify the full potential of a human or a student. At least HSC doesn&amp;rsquo;t! I have attended all the exams of HSC 25 so I know better than any boomers. Here exams are not equal to everyone. One may get some benefit and another may not. So, it might give you a preliminary idea about a person. Though, sometimes, that idea even goes wrong. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen countless people those who didn&amp;rsquo;t do well in HSC but still they are living a good life. They are brilliant and they are no lesser than any other talented students. Now let us get back to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, questions were so freaking difficult. Not everyone could answer it properly. Those who were hardworking students, they could only answer those. Then would get A+. However, in this way, we can exclude people, those who do not deserve an A+. Thus, we can normalize the fact that getting 4.69 isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad result. Consider only 60 students got A+ in Dhaka board. Then will our parents and the society gonna compare all of us with those 60 people? If they do then it will be pathetic. I believe they will not do. But if 70% students get A+ and the rest can not, then definitely there will be people to say why you weren&amp;rsquo;t in that 70%. Yeah, I said 60, which is a bit unrealistic for this decade but once people saw this sort of era. This year the rate of A+ won&amp;rsquo;t fall so badly, which is clearly visible. But, certainly a downfall will occur. Somehow our standard is messed up (not brining how it got). Hope it gets fixed soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my POV and with my ignorance, I&amp;rsquo;ll say that questions were easy for those who studied. I didn&amp;rsquo;t study so I must not find it easy. If I had studied I would have found it easier. This is the fact here. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to blame others for my failure. Today, it was the worst HSC exam I have ever attended! But, still I have the balls to subdue the sadness that occurs or the tendency of blaming others for my own failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I hate studying biology</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/july-25/i-hate-biology/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 18:41:48 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/july-25/i-hate-biology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another note is gonna, probably, make me fall asleep. Whenever I try to write something, I start feeling asleep. Thus, I say to myself that the topic can go to hell and why should I talk about it and I sleep. Hopefully, I will not be writing this note fully like all the other unpublished notes. Tonight, I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything specific to talk about. It will be about what I am going through right now. Within a day, I will be attending the Biology exam. I never liked Biology and never wanted to learn because it is a pain to study biology in our curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology is a nice subject I will say. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting when I study it willingly . But when the curriculum forces me to  memorize the reactions of photosynthesis and respiration, gymnosperms and angiosperms, all those diversities of species and every possible bullshit, It is unbearable. I am reluctant to study biology. I took it as an optional subject. Though, it is optional but it is rather more important than any other subjects cause it can increase points on those subjects where I may not get A+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a tendency to not do something that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. Manly which needs a lot of memorization. Math is also about memorization. Some say it isn&amp;rsquo;t but at one point it is. All those formulas and types where we can&amp;rsquo;t go further if we are unaware about any of these. But still math is enjoyable. Formulas can easily be memorized by writing it a few times. Even organic chemistry seems easier than biology. Sounds funny, right? But it&amp;rsquo;s my perspective. I ain&amp;rsquo;t a good student who&amp;rsquo;s getting A+ this time but still it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me inept at determining the difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, hope this phase of Biology goes quick and obviously well. Later I&amp;rsquo;ll have math to deal with. It won&amp;rsquo;t be so exhausting like biology. I am not saying I am good with math but at least I have an interest in studying it. I am waiting till this thing ends. I would be happy if they didn&amp;rsquo;t allot that much gap between exams. It sucks my energy badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing tomorrow. Problem, just going to accept the fate. Now just before the exam, now I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything in mind. Pretty, tough situation. I wish there was nothing called society. If the society wasn&amp;rsquo;t there to judge me by my results then probably students wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so terrified of getting poor marks. At least I can say that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hang themselves. Not a big fan of suicide. Our society has to change their mindset. Maybe it will happen one day but it will take so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&#34;https://8amiul.github.io/posts/may-25/awful-day/&#34;&gt;Awful day&lt;/a&gt; incarcerated!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happiness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it. Maybe&amp;hellip; one day&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll add more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to save daily realizations and things I go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I accept the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ll get what I deserve. [26/06/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I accept my limits and capabilities that I was not willing to alter. [29/06/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I trust my gut and make my own decision to face its consequence. [01/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I can let things go and assume my next step. [04/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I sleep the reminiscence away.  [06/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is when I implement my ideas on their ideas to perfectionate it for myself. [08/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough realizations for now. [27/07/25]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Did I have a cold drink that day?</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/may-25/cold-drink/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:27:39 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/may-25/cold-drink/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;rsquo;t remember. It was a year ago. I just got into college. Traveling was so tiring for me and, I believe, for everyone living in Dhaka. That enormous traffic and pollution was enough to put myself down. I was new to college, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the best route to reach there. I used to travel by bus. Which wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best way of traveling. But at least the way it was, which I knew at that time. Then days passed, and I found another path, which has its own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So about cold drinks, I used to become so thirsty as I had to walk a lot. I would crave something cold. I mostly wanted a nice lemonade. I could have a simple one from a roadside vendor, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so tasteful. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of hygiene. But it&amp;rsquo;s not like I haven&amp;rsquo;t had lemonade from them. I had quite a lot. I used to go to college with one of my friends. We had to walk a lot; we sometimes stopped to get a lemonade. It actually attracts us to go there. Humidity and tiredness would make us want something cold. Also, it looks so nice to see lemons, ice cubes, and people drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually tasty. I saw how they make it. It&amp;rsquo;s so simple and fast. What they do is just add a little lemon, obviously water, and ice cubes. Nobody knows about its origin. Those ice cubes can even be from the morgue; who cares? All I want is temporary satisfaction. So ice cubes and an unknown recipe looked like salt. Some kind of mixture it was. Then mix it and serve. Quite easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking that would satisfy me, but it would make me a bit more exhausted. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. I know it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the case, but it happens to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn, that was a long road and quite a hassle. Getting on a bus and having a seat was an amazing challenge at that time. I have made a lot of bad choices in my life. One of them was choosing a college that was 9 km far from my home. It might not be a huge distance for people around the world. But here it is a great distance. Time is a valuable thing. Taking decisions like this costs both energy and time. So it means it was just nothing but ruining a beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have passed those days. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to college anymore. I have a bigger challenge. Maybe when I&amp;rsquo;m in university I&amp;rsquo;ll have to go through this kind of hassle once again. That&amp;rsquo;s how it works here, right? Or maybe everywhere. Suffering is everywhere; suffering is for everyone. One suffers through poverty and another through abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how was life back then? I thought I had enough time for everything. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know or never tried to understand that time flies so fast. I had a lot of dreams to fulfill. A different ambition, different mindset, different companionship, and different future assumptions. Now I am standing at this date, and I see everything so differently. It didn&amp;rsquo;t go according to my assumptions or plans. It&amp;rsquo;s not the worst, though, but a lot of things have changed, and I am trying my best to get adjusted to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a huge post I&amp;rsquo;ve written that goes with my life. Not a very great life-changing speech it is. But why must we always seek motivation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let me mention some of the realizations that I&amp;rsquo;ve made and end this shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept unexpected consequences and changes in life because it&amp;rsquo;s an uncertain simulation of the creator of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s replacement is on the way, and when the replacement arrives, one may replace it with no remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s flower may become tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s thorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a nap and drinking enough water can sometimes be a solution to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major decisions should be taken in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take less stress and be optimistic, because life is what you make it. It is painful if you see one better than you, and it is joyous if the better one is you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, people will try to suck your blood, but you gotta point them toward somewhere else of you so they can suck that instead. (ifykyk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to post, so I did post my thoughts here. It might not help you, but it helps me. We have nothing in our control. We neither can control us nor them. What we have in control is our judgment. How do we accept and how do we not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is love? Baby don&#39;t hurt me... - Haddaway</title>
      <link>https://8amiul.github.io/posts/oh-my-flower/</link>

        height: auto; 
        padding: 0.5rem 1rem 0.5rem 1rem;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another blog it is! I&amp;rsquo;ll write about something that none of you may have expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in their life goes through it, and they sacrifice everything for it. They put a lot of efforts but does it actually help? Well, it depends. Some can make it and the rest move on. Move on with an intention to be better next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article that actually opened my mind. I am going through pretty bad time of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll say. I am no good writer who can encourage or motivate you, but I&amp;rsquo;ve something that can actually help you go through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll mark some lines from the article named &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/love&#34;&gt;Love Is Not Enough&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which is written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/about&#34;&gt;Mark Manson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he came up with this, but everyone should read it even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced the so-called love thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he started with two characters. One idealized love and another didn&amp;rsquo;t. Idealizing love means taking love as a solution to all of his problems. Thus, we experience that dark side of &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
And because we idealize love, we overestimate it. As a result, our relationships pay a price.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the article I found something called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/personal-values&#34;&gt;fundamental values&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; of love I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some hints were given such as respect, humility and commitment. We had a commitment which failed nicely. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t have those two things respect and humility. And yeah, we fought a lot. We blamed each other. Ruined day and nights. So messed up shit it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toxic relationships are kind of like a boat on emotions. Keep rowing, and suddenly it gets overwhelmed with emotions and both sink in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
After all, if love solves everything, then why bother with all the other stuff? all the hard stuff?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idealizing love causes unrealistic expectations about love. Let us dive in to three harsh truths about love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-does-not-equal-compatibility&#34;&gt;Love Does Not Equal Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Just because you fall in love with someone doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they?re a good partner for you to be with over the long term. Love is an &lt;b style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;emotional&lt;/b&gt; process. Compatibility is a &lt;b style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;logical&lt;/b&gt; process. And the two don&#39;t bleed into one another very well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s true. Did anyone say that if you love someone that means they are the perfect one for you? The article also mentions that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It&#39;s possible to fall in love with somebody who sucks for us and our happiness.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It&#39;s possible to fall in love with somebody who has different ambitions or life goals that are contradictory to our own, who holds different philosophical beliefs or worldviews that clash with our own sense of reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel the spark, and we jump and we fall. That&amp;rsquo;s how things work in a toxic relation. Then we consider that what went wrong? But what actually went wrong is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
It went wrong before it even began.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not wrong to love someone, but we fail to understand the fundamental values of love that is mentioned in the article. We don&amp;rsquo;t value each other&amp;rsquo;s ambitions, thoughts and worldviews. We consider them to be like us. Thus forcing them to be one of us cause clashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-does-not-solve-your-relationship-problems&#34;&gt;Love Does Not Solve Your Relationship Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found a comment on Reddit that said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re ever walking in the woods, and you see the same tree twice, you&amp;rsquo;re lost son&amp;rdquo; was the best relationship advice my grandpa told me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked it. That actually clarifies that if a relationship fails once it will hardly succeed. Obviously there are exceptions but let&amp;rsquo;s talk about majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So talking in emotions make problems look like they are solvable but in reality it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Keep doing the same thing such as patching it again then getting hurt is just an absolute truth in those relationships that failed once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who actually think logically on those times? Nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we should learn is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
While love may make you feel better about your relationship problems, it doesn&#39;t actually solve any of your relationship problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-is-not-always-worth-sacrificing-yourself-for&#34;&gt;Love Is Not Always Worth Sacrificing Yourself For&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsession is a pretty bad thing. Obsession leads you to addiction. Addiction is way worse. When we love someone in a crazy sense it will eventually fail. Cause there will be questions in your mind that why I am not getting what I give, I don&amp;rsquo;t get the same love, I treat them well but do they? And many other questions will rise like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If respecting each other if one still gets this questions then yes maybe they are not the right person for you. I believe why wasting time like this? You give love, in return you get nothing. Then why still be there? Be there because of addiction or the hell called obsession. If you one wants to unfuck a relation then fuck the obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
In loving relationships, it&#39;s normal for both people to occasionally sacrifice their own desires, their own needs, and their own time for one another. I would argue that this is normal and healthy and a big part of what makes a relationship so great.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What love it is if you don&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
But when it comes to sacrificing one&#39;s self-respect, one&#39;s dignity, one&#39;s physical body, one&#39;s ambitions and life purpose, just to be with someone, then that same love becomes problematic.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&#34;color:rgb(226, 108, 216);  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
A loving relationship is supposed to supplement our individual identity, not damage it or replace it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we still tolerate those damages that we both make just for the sake of love and affection, or I&amp;rsquo;ll say obsession. We fail to differentiate love and obsession. Whatever I shall make another post about obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we keep holding it then we will allow ruining our self-respect and image. This way our energy will get sucked which we don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the part that actually I needed which is &lt;em&gt;The Friendship Test&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts from the article says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
One of the oldest pieces of relationship advice in the book is, &lt;p style=&#34;color: gray;&#34;&gt;You and your partner should be best friends.?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt; Most people look at that piece of advice in the positive: I should spend time with my partner like I do with my best friend, I should communicate openly with my partner like I do with my best friend, I should have fun with my partner like I do with my best friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But people should also look at it in the negative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color:rgb(226, 108, 216);  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Would you tolerate your partner&#39;s negative behaviors in your best friend?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I answer then obviously not. With friends, I am not afraid of saying any bullshit. They ought to accept my dark humour, stupidity, fun and jokes whatsoever. I&amp;rsquo;ll be open to them. A friend is made with trust so love is. But if you can&amp;rsquo;t do the same with your partner then what freedom you get? At the end of the day you have to be with your friends just to share something that makes both of you laugh. Well, obviously we should be respectful then treat our loved ones a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our partner should be our best friend but being in the boundary I believe. Being open and less judgemental is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
Why do we tolerate behavior in our romantic relationships that we would never ever, ever tolerate in our friendships?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy answer is that we are in love that&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final thing to remember,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;color: #B9B28A;  font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;
The only way you can fully enjoy the love in your life is to choose to make something else more important in your life than love.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, love is a nice thing to experience. Loving someone isn&amp;rsquo;t bad. We can fall in love on those who might be bad for use even good for us. But we should not be sacrificing these few things such as self-respect, dignity, ability to trust because they are hard to get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should let go. Not think that we won&amp;rsquo;t get someone like them in our life again. Be happy. Get indulged in sadness. Let us feel the pain. It is a lesson. Oh! I should mention something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you read this masterpiece? A book called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/The%20Subtle%20Art%20of%20Not%20Giving%20a%20Fck%20A%20Counterintuitive%20Approach%20to%20Living%20a%20Good%20Life%20by%20Mark%20Manson%20(z-lib.org).pdf&#34;&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; You can buy if you want. But a direct PDF link is attached here. I&amp;rsquo;ll highly suggest reading this book. It covers a lot of lessons that one must be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me taking a nap helps a lot. Getting busy is the solution. Replacing never should be a solution cause now you seek attention, now you seek the cure of your loneliness not love. Write like me. Keep notes, it helps. We should not love those who don&amp;rsquo;t love us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time is the only cure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img class=&#34;post-center-image&#34; src=&#34;https://8amiul.github.io/images/fire_writing.gif&#34; alt=&#34;[Fire writing]&#34; title=&#34;Fire writing&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I should stop writing. If you have read all of these from the beginning I thank you very much. I write blog posts just to spend my time, and it feels better to express my thoughts. Who cares whether someone has read it or not. Self-satisfaction i&amp;rsquo;ll say. At least I can fill that &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; page with something. Post which is huge like this looks cool though.&lt;/p&gt;
