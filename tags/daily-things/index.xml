      <description>I just cooked my first meal of this year. So it&amp;rsquo;s a new year and Today I woke up early.
I just thought it&amp;rsquo;s better I try something new today. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I make my own breakfast?
Noodles was the only food I knew how to cook. So I started cooking. I took noodles, then egg and some veggies (actually left over salad from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s party).
However it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cooked properly.</description>
