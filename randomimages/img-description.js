            I tried running ArchLinux on my rooted phone. It was running on chroot env.
            so I was able to do most of the linux stuff there but the only limit was the CPU architecture!

            Who clicked that picture? It was my paternal uncle.

            tf is that? They teach us that you can treat the derivative operator as a fraction but well then they say it isn't actually a fraction
            Why just treat it like that? Let's learn the core.
